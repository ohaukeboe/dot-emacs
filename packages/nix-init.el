;;; nix-init.el --- Utilities for working with Nix-shell -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides utilities for working with Nix-shell files. It
;; assumes that the Nix-shell file is in the root of the project and
;; that you use direnv.

;; TODO: Add a function to add a package to the shell.nix file.
;; TODO: nix-direnv has a template flake which could be used for flake projects.

;;; Code:
